## Project Description

The Multi-Signal Viewer Application is a Python-based desktop application developed using the PyQt framework. This application is designed for the visualization and analysis of multi-port, multi-channel medical signals, making it a valuable tool for medical professionals and researchers.

## Features

- #### Signal Import:
  Users can browse their PC to open a variety of medical signal files, including ECG, EMG, EEG, and more. Each signal type includes examples of both normal and abnormal signals.
- #### Dual Graphs:
  The application features two identical graphs, each with its own set of controls. Users can open different signal files in each graph and run them independently.
- #### Graph Linking:
  Users can link the two graphs together, ensuring that they display the same time frames, signal speed, and viewport settings. If one graph is zoomed or panned, the other graph automatically synchronizes.
- #### Cine Mode:
  Signals are displayed in a cine mode, simulating real-time monitoring, similar to ICU monitors. Users can also rewind the signal to the beginning.
- #### User Controls:
  The application provides a range of user-friendly controls, including options to:
  - Change signal colors
  - Add labels/titles to each signal
  - Show/hide individual signals
  - Adjust cine speed
  - Zoom in/out
  - Pause/play/rewind signals
  - Scroll and pan signals using sliders and mouse movements
  - Move signals between graphs
